A pattern I saw with these common mistakes was that the model confused classes which looked relatively similar (simialr features/traits) to one another. For example, 4 and 9, 3 and 5, and 2 and 7 do look somewhat similar, so it is not a surprise that the computer confused them since the k-nearest neighbor algorithm used here is relatively simple."

So, this is how computers \"see.\" They convert an image into a matrix of values, that matrix becomes a vector in a dataset, and then we deploy ML tools on it as if it was any other kind of tabular data. To make sure you follow this, invent a way to represent a color photo in matrix form, and then describe how you could convert it into tabular data.

For an image of size 28x28 this matrix would have dimensions 28x28x3, with each pixel containing an RGB triplet. Now the image is stored as a matrix of values, and so the next step would be to flatten the RGB values for each pixel into a single row, creating a table where each row represents a pixel, and the columns represent the RGB intensities. Now, the pixel data can be used for ML tools."
